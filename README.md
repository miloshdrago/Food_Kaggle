# Food Recognition Kaggle Competition

The dataset consists of 30612 images for the training set and 7653 images for the test set.


Food classification is a challenging problem due to the large number of food categories, since the visual similarity between different food categories is high. 

The goal is to build a model to predict the fine-grained food-category label given an image. This dataset contains 80 food categories indicated with a number.

## Files

    • train_set - the training set with 30612 images
    • train_labels.csv - the correct labels for the training set
    • test_set - the test set with 7653 images
    • sample.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format

## Data fields

    • img_name - The unique identifier for each image
    • label - The food category that the image belongs to. This is a value between 1 to 80.

The images in the training set have an image name starting with train_. Images in the test set have an image name starting with test_.
